# BwtFS: Privacy-Preserving File System
[**üåè ‰∏≠Êñá**](https://github.com/zaoweiceng/BwtFS/blob/master/README.zh-CN.md)
## Project Overview
This project aims to research and implement an efficient file system focused on protecting the privacy of users' private files. In multi-user or highly confidential environments, this system ensures the secure use of files.
## Main Goals
- Design and implement an anti-tracing privacy storage model.
- Build a non-recoverable data access system.
- Achieve protocol-layer transparent privacy protection.
## Design Highlights
- **Anti-Tracing Privacy Storage**: Ensures that stored files cannot be traced back to the original user, effectively protecting user privacy.
- **Non-Recoverable Data Access**: Uses special mechanisms to ensure that even if data is accessed illegally, the original information cannot be recovered.
- **Protocol-Layer Transparency**: Implements privacy protection at the protocol level, requiring no additional user actions and providing a seamless user experience.
## Applicable Scenarios
- **Multi-User Environments**: Such as enterprises, schools, and other scenarios where file sharing is necessary but personal privacy must be protected.
- **Highly Confidential Environments**: Such as government, financial institutions, and other scenarios with high file security requirements.
## Project Vision
Through the implementation of this project, we aim to provide users with a secure, reliable, and convenient file storage and usage environment, effectively protecting user privacy and preventing data leaks.
